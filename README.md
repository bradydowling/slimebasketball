Slime basketball is a java game that I love(d) playing with my friends and brothers when I was in high school. I still enjoy playing a game or two when I'm bored so I wanted to do a remake of it. Initially I just want to get an exact clone down of it then I'll add some new styling and features to it.

It is basically a direct port but there were certain parts of the code that needed to be restructured simply because I'm using JavaScript and not Java. It uses an engine called EaselJS (CreateJS). I've never used a game engine before and I've never even made a game before but the engine seems very simple to me. Contributions or suggestions are welcomed with open arms.
